# Online IDE

* focus on the two browsers: Chrome (63+) and FireFox (57+) for Windows, Mac, and Linux
   * no support for tablets yet (JavaScript engine is too slow on arm processors)
   * no support for mobile phones (makes no sense due to the small screen size)
* the other browsers are not in focus to keep testing overhead in limits (but bugs will be reported for future)
   * does not work on Edge (see https://github.com/EmbeddedMontiArc/onlineIDE/issues/35)
   * works only on Safari when disabling Cross-Site-Scripting in Developer-Mode (see https://github.com/EmbeddedMontiArc/OCL/issues/14)
