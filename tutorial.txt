Tutorial

1. Accelerate to a given speed and brake.
    Implement a model that continuously accelerates to a speed of 50 km/h and stops accelerating upon reaching this speed.
    After 3 seconds the car is braking until full stop.
    
Explanation:

The car has 8 sensors to measure distances to obstacles. They are located: PICTURE
You have an access to acceleration and rotation of the car. Changing these two parameter you may control the behavior ot the car.

You have to come up with controller which will be able to move the car in accordance with the task.

To be able to reach 50 km/h speed, you have to accelerate the car continuously until it reaches the desired speed.
