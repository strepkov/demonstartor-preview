<h3 id="maneuverabilitytestdrivebetweencones">Maneuverability test - drive between cones.</h3>

<p>Implement a model that manages a a driving between cones, which emulates the maneuverability test. The model has to have several modules which are responsible for different actions. One of the examples could be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Module controls the speed of the car</li>

<li>Module is responsible for a steering angle of the car, depends form current position.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each module should be as simple as possible.</p>

<p>To solve this tutorial you may use from 4 to 6 sensors, which measure the distance to objects which are located in front/side of the car. The speed has to be around 1-2 m/s. At the picture you can see the main idea how the driving has to be done:</p>

<p><img src="../img/drive_cones.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The parking process can be divided in several steps steps:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Go straight until a cone it closer the 10m then start to rotate the car to round the cone.</li>

<li>When a front part of the car is passed the cone, start to rotate in opposite direction.</li>

<li>When the car is rotated enough to pass the next cone, stop rotation and continue moving straight.</li>

<li>Repeat the second step until pass all cones.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important to know, this wed-simulator is a simplified version and it does not change the angle of front wheels but an angle of the car entirely.</strong></p>

<p>Hint: In this task will be helpful to use the static variables like a counters.</p>
