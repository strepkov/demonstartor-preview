<h3 id="tocarryoutaparallelparkingbetweentwocars">To carry out a parallel parking between two cars.</h3>

<p>Implement a model that manages a parking between two cars. The model has to have several modules which are responsible for different actions. One of the examples could be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Module which controls the speed of the car, depends on the current action(e.g. parking, searching a parking place).</li>

<li>Module which looking for a gap between cars for the parking.</li>

<li>Module which controls a steering of the car during the parking process.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each module should be as simple as possible.</p>

<p>To solve this tutorial you have to use at least 6 sensors, which measure the distance to objects which are located in front/left side/back of the car. The speed has to be around 0.5-1 m/s. At the picture you can see the main idea how the parking has to be done:</p>

<p><img src="../img/parking_process1.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The parking process can be divided in 4 steps:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Go straight until a place have been found.</li>

<li>When the place is found, go back and rotate the car.</li>

<li>When the car has reached appropriate point, rotate car in other direction to fit into given gap between the cars.</li>

<li>When the car is close to the car behind, stop and go forward until it reaches certain distance to the front car.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important to know, this wed-simulator is a simplified version and it does not change the angle of front wheels but an angle of the car entirely.</strong></p>
