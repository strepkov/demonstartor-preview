# Tutorial(01)

## Accelerate the given time and stop simulation.
Implement the model that continuously accelerates 10 seconds with acceleration 0.5 m/s^2 and then stops a simulation.

To solve this task you have to use the MainController with defined interface to the simulator(from the tutorial 00) and then create your own controller which behaves in desired way.
