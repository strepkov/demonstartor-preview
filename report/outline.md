Outline

- Motivation
    gamification
- Problem definition
(describe why we need this tool and which advantages we will have)
- Related work
(describe the different approaches which have some tutorials like we did in the article?, unity, (extend existing ones))
- Preliminaries
	- EmbeddedMontiArc language
	- EMA Tooling: Emam2Cpp (part which generate tests), Emam2Wasm, SVG generator, OnlineIDE
	- ThreeJS (lightweight cross-browser JavaScript library/API)(how to add new objects)
- Tutorials
(how we can divide this topic?(different tutorials, running example, summary, present some completely, trajectory why we need it))
- Toolchain implementation
	- 3D web-simulator
	- Client-side layer(process files(receive/send), tutorial management, trajectory comp.)
	- Server side (file processing, external modules execution)
	- CoCoChecker(general description what has been done, mention MontiCore)
- Evaluation(?)
	- performance(more math or more components what is working faster?)
- Future work(?)
	- compilation directly in a browser
	- using different tracks
	- standalone tutorial builder
