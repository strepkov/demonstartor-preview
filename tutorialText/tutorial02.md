# Tutorial(02)

### Accelerate and then stop about 10 meters before an obstacle.
Implement the model that continuously accelerate the car with acceleration 1 m/s^2 and then the simulation is ended when the distance to an obstacle about 10 meters.

To solve this tutorial you have to use two front sensors, which measure the distance to objects which are located in front of the car.
