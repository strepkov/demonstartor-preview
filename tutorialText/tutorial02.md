# Tutorial(02)

### Accelerate and then stop about 10 meters before an obstacle.
Implement the model that continuously accelerate the car with acceleration 1 m/s^2 and then the simulation is ended when the distance to an obstacle about 10 meters.

To solve this tutorial you have to use two front sensors, which measure the distance to objects which are located in front of the car. Hint: you can use logical operations the same way like you get used to do it in other languages(or ||, and &&). The actual obstacle will be the border of the road in front of the car.
