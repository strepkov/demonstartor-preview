# Tutorial(01)

##### Accelerate the given time and brake.
Implement the model that continuously accelerates 10 seconds with acceleration 1 m/s^2 and then brakes with negative acceleration -1m/s^2.

To solve this task you have to use the MainController with defined interface to the simulator(from the tutorial 00) and then create your own controller which behaves in desired way.
