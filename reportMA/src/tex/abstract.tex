{\bf\Large Abstract} \\ [1em]
Cyber-physical systems become highly popular in our everyday life. One of these systems is self-driving vehicles in automotive industry. To design and develop that kind of systems, component and connector(C\&C) models are widely used. This thesis is focused on creating a tool which can handle a learning process of C\&C modeling principles. EmbeddedMontiArc has been chosen as one of the most advanced programming languages, which based on the C\&C modelling. Furthermore, it is not sufficient to have an environment for the development, it is important to have enthralling tutorials which reveal all advantages of the C\&C modeling. The presented tutorials apply the gamification principles, which become popular nowadays through a good learning outcome. To build a comprehensive teaching tool, we analysed existing tutorials and playgrounds, to derive important requirements for the future product. Then, we create an architecture and explain the implementation of components, besides the technologies, that were used during the development process. Then, we describe how to use the environment to achieve high productivity during the learning process. Finally, the group of tutorials are presented, with the real examples and step-by-step solutions.
