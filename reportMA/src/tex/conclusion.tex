\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, a new education environment for learning C\&C modeling language EmbeddedMontiArc has been developed. Moreover, it has already integrated first eleven tutorials, which teach student C\&C modeling step-by-step.From the very beginning, we have analyzed the existing tutorials in various fields. The purpose was to find the most important features, which have an influence on the studying process, and even discover the weaknesses and try to overcome them. Then we have figured out the most suitable architecture, which is partially using the already implemented solutions, what decreases the amount of work, and at the same time, does not influence negatively on an user experience. After that, the implementation of missing components in the toolchain was given, which describes the main algorithms and describes which were made during development process. Lately, was shown how to use the tutorials' tool to be productive during development new models. Then, the group of the tutorials was presented. They present: two tutorial for beginners with explanation of basics; two interesting real-world examples, which present the main concepts and reveal important integrated features; one large final tutorial, which summarize the experience derived from all previous tutorials. At the very end, the future possibles enhancements are proposed, which were not implemented due to some technical restrictions, which currently exist, or lack of time, that was given for the thesis implementation.
